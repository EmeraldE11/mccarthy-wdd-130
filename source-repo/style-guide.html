            <h2>Fonts</h2>
            <p>
                I have chosen to use the following fonts for my site:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    STICK: Used for headlines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    JOSEFIN SANS: Used for the primary font.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
            <p>
                I find animals to be fascinating. A lot of unique animals don’t get the 
                attention they deserve, and I want people to find them as fascinating as I do. 
                I’m familiar with building websites, and want to build one that gives information 
                on less popular animals. It would be informationally rich, and feature images and 
                explanations on special features they have. This would be original because it’s
                focus would be on animals that don’t ever get the spotlight. Wouldn’t you be 
                interested to learn about animals you’ve never even heard of, like the aye aye, 
                tarsier, and mantis shrimp? What about unspoken facts about animals you do know
                like the kangaroo, octopus, or chameleon? My website could give people that opportunity.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of my website will be to create an environment of learning about 
                the more unseen parts of the animal kingdom. Sharing information will be the 
                basis of this website, serving as a compilation of facts from animals both 
                popular and hidden that can inspire people about the wonders of nature. By doing 
                so, we hope to increase interest in zoos and other events centered around animals. 
                By pouring more revenue into the animal industry, more will inevitably be used 
                to help wildlife in need and people will have more access to seeing and 
                experiencing these surprisingly complex creatures.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Audience Statement</h2>
            <p>
                This website is going to be geared towards a slightly mature audience, 
                mainly teens and above. They’ll need the maturity and capacity to understand 
                the content, and the teenage age group is probably most likely to visit a 
                site with this content. They will be interested in the novelty of interesting 
                information, and likely possess a casual love for animals already. This 
                website will likely be accessed through laptop and mobile device the most 
                frequently, and as the purpose suggests, they will be seeking information 
                they didn’t know about popular animals, and information on animals they weren’t 
                even aware of.
            </p>

            <h2>Misson Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Our mission is to foster an environment of learning and curiosity, as well 
                as support the quality of our planet and all of its inhabitants. We plan to 
                do so by sparking the minds of people by educating them about unique animals 
                with special abilities. This will in turn provide the world with ways to 
                connect over common interests and motivate individual and community growth. 
                It will also more subtly promote a green lifestyle so that we can save and 
                preserve the animal kingdom and improve our own standard of living. We 
                value and actively encourage learning, environmental awareness, and wildlife, 
                and seek to spread those values.
